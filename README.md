I’m a passionate Full Stack Web Developer currently deepening my knowledge of modern web technologies through a bootcamp. My skills include front-end development with HTML, CSS, and React, server-side programming with Node.js, and database management with PostgreSQL. I’m also experienced in Agile methodologies, Git version control, and deploying applications with Docker.

With a strong background in UX/UI Design, I’ve honed my ability to create user-centered experiences and aesthetically pleasing interfaces using tools like Figma, Adobe XD, and the Adobe Creative Suite. I also completed a Bilingual Customer Service Representative program, where I strengthened my communication, writing, and professional business etiquette.

Additionally, I bring diverse experience as a game artist, content creator, bakery owner, and community support worker. In each role, I’ve focused on improving user experiences, whether through creating intuitive game visuals, sharing travel content, managing a business, or providing personalized care plans to individuals with special needs.

I’m eager to leverage my skills and experience in the IT field to build impactful applications and support digital innovation. Let’s connect!
